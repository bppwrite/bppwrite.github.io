[Donate to the 2016 Ike & Julie Arnove PlayOffs!](http://www.razoo.com/story/2013-Ike-And-Julie-Arnove-Playoffs)

It’s that time of the year again for the Ike & Julie Arnove PlayOffs. The time of year when we separate the contenders from the pretenders, the pros from the joes, the heroes from the zeros. Yes, that’s right, the baseball playoffs are just around the corner. In celebration, the BPP is presenting its most electrifying, action-packed, and anticipated fundraising event of the year, the Ike & Julie Arnove PlayOffs.
Just what are The PlayOffs, you ask? On November 5 and 6, 9 playwrights, 9 directors, and 27 actors will have 24 hours to write, direct, and produce a full production based on a surprise theme, prop, and line of dialogue.
Sound cool? It is.

Encouraging the competitive spirit, the artists are broken up into teams, each containing a "Manager"(playwright), "Coach" (director) and three "Players" (actors). The teams then compete in the World Series PlayOffs (2 full performances) on November 5 and 6 at 7:30pm.
Audience members are invited to vote for their favorite play and actor, and (after the votes have been tallied) the MVP and World Series Champion are crowned after the final Sunday night performance.
But, before the first pitch is thrown, Team Owners and the participating artists have to raise money to get their team on the field and improve their draft ranking. The more money they raise, the better their chances are for winning the World Series or even an MVP award.
