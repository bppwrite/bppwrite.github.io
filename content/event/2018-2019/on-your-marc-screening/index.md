Do you remember when beloved TV icon Marc Summers produced his one-man show Everything in Its Place: The Life and Slimes of Marc Summers at BPP? We sure do. Well, while that was going on, a documentary crew was filming.

Fast forward 2 years... Surprise! Marc is joining us again this fall to present a sneak preview screening of the completed feature-length documentary! On Your Marc intimately captures his life, career, and legacy. The Indianapolis native looks back on his "messy" ups and downs as he works through the production and opening night of Everything In Its Place: The Life & Slimes of Marc Summers, the hilariously illuminating one-man show, co-written by Broadway stars Alex Brightman (Tony-nominated lead in School of Rock: The Musical) and composer Drew Gasparini. The film combines a scrappy, “anything goes” appeal with an insightful look at being in the spotlight through surviving cancer, a near-fatal car crash, and a lifelong bout with OCD.

On Your Marc lovingly features BPP, and the city of Bloomington, with countless scenes shot here at the theater and throughout the community. Don't miss your chance to see it first with Marc, his Slimes co-star Mike Nappi, and BPP Producing Artistic Director, Chad Rabinovitz. All three will be hosting an in-person Q&A session right after the film.
