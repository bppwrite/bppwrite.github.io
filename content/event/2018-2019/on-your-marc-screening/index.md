Do you remember back in 2016 when beloved TV icon, Marc Summers, premiered his one-man show *Everything in Its Place: The Life and Slimes of Marc Summers* at BPP? We sure do. Well, while that was going on, a documentary crew was filming.

Fast forward 2 years... Surprise! Marc is joining us again this fall for a sneak preview screening of the completed film! *On Your Marc* intimately captures his life, career, and legacy. The Indianapolis native looks back on his "messy" ups and downs as he works through the production of that hilariously illuminating one-man show, co-written by Broadway stars Alex Brightman (Tony-nominated lead in School of Rock: The Musical) and composer Drew Gasparini. The film combines a scrappy, “anything goes” appeal with an insightful look at being in the spotlight through surviving cancer, a near-fatal car crash, and a lifelong bout with OCD.

Don't miss your chance to see this love-letter to BPP and the City of Bloomington, right where it all began. A post-film discussion with Marc Summers, his *Slimes* co-star Mike Nappi, and BPP Producing Artistic Director Chad Rabinovitz, will follow the screening.
