 This June 6th, we are throwing ourselves a 40th Birthday Celebration! Start the night out at 6:30 with donated food, wine, and beer! Then move into the theatre for the announcement of our 2019-2020 Season and a staged read of the 2014 SMASH HIT *Kalamazoo*. Join the original cast and relive the wonderful story of BPP's best selling show of all time. Then stick around for the announcement of the 2019-20 Season (our 40th!). Then finish the evening with a toast to BPP and the opportunity to buy us some presents (but cash is fine too!). Only $25 for this event and all proceeds go to supporting the quality work you have come to expect from the BPP.
