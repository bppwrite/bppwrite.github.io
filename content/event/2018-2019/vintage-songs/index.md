 This June, we invite you to expand your dramatic palate with an all-new show featuring a performance of favorite songs from BPP's original musicals, as well as the announcement of the 2018-19 Season. The evening begins Thursday, June 14, 2018 with a full buffet dinner at 6:30pm, followed by the performances at 7:30pm. A cash bar with wine will also be open. This year weâ€™ll be at the Oliver Winery Creekbend Vineyard at 7508 N Woodall Road, in Ellettsville.
