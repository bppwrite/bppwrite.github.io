BPP Board member Von Welch and Oddball Fermentables are teaming up to bring you this special opportunity to support BPP and enjoy the local crafted mead from right here in Bloomington. This will be a private event and the owner of Oddball Fermentables, Drew Schrader, will be telling you all about the mead. This option is perfect for those wanting to do dinner and a show. The event will wrap up with enough time to see that night's performance of APPROPOS OF NOTHING! Prepare yourself for a great night out in Bloomington.
