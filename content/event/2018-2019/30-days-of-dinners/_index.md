You are invited to BPP's 30 Days of Dinner, a brand new special event taking the place of our annual gala. 30 Days of Dinner is unlike any of the other events. It happens over the entire month of January instead of one single day. Tired of seeing the same people at gatherings of over 100 at a ballroom? We have close knit dinners and parties at the homes of some of the world's greatest hosts. There is something for everyone.

Masquerades, Viewing parties, Tapas dinners, Wine tastings and more. All of this for HALF the price of BPP's usual gala. $50 a person gets you a seat at some of the best tables in Bloomington and 100% of the profit goes back to BPP.

Just peruse through the dates on the top right of this page for times, locations, themes and food for these events. When you are ready to pick which dinner or dinners you want, contact Managing Director Brad Schiesser  [812-334-1188](tel:+1-812-334-1188) or [brad@newplays.org](mailto:brad@newplays.org)
