Do you remember back in 2016 when beloved TV icon, Marc Summers, premiered his one-man show *Everything in Its Place: The Life and Slimes of Marc Summers* at BPP? We sure do. Well, while that was going on, a documentary crew was filming.

Fast forward 2 years... Surprise! Marc is joining us again this fall for a sneak preview screening of the completed film! *On Your Marc* intimately captures his life, career, and legacy. The Indianapolis native looks back on his "messy" ups and downs as he works through the production of that hilariously illuminating one-man show, co-written by Broadway stars Alex Brightman (Tony-nominated lead in School of Rock: The Musical) and composer Drew Gasparini. The film combines a scrappy, “anything goes” appeal with an insightful look at being in the spotlight through surviving cancer, a near-fatal car crash, and a lifelong bout with OCD.

Don't miss your chance to see this love-letter to BPP and the City of Bloomington. A post-film discussion with Marc Summers, his *Slimes* co-star Mike Nappi, and BPP Producing Artistic Director Chad Rabinovitz, will follow the screening.

Tickets may be purchased online or in person at the IU Auditorium. To purchase tickets online, you will need an IU Auditorium account. Please call the IU Auditorium Box Office at (812) 855-1103 M-F 10am-5pm with any questions about creating or accessing your account.
