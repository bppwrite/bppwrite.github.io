 After how much fun we had last year, BPP is throwing itself another Birthday Celebration in 2020! Start the night out at 6:30 with donated food, wine, and beer! Then move into the theatre for the announcement of our 2020-2021 Season and a staged reading of the 2011 SMASH HIT *Still the River Runs* starring the original cast (Gabe Gloden & Daniel J. Petrie). Then stick around for the announcement of the 2020-21 Season (our 41st!). Then finish the evening with a toast to BPP and the opportunity to buy us some presents (but cash is fine too!). Only $25 for this event and all proceeds go to supporting the quality work you have come to expect from the BPP.
