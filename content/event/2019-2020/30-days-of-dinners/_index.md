You are invited to BPP's 30 Days of Dinner. It happens over the entire month of February and into March instead of one single day, so you can find the day that works best for you! Tired of seeing the same 100 people at stuffy ballroom gatherings? We have close knit dinners and parties at the homes of some of the world's greatest hosts. There is something for everyone.

Masquerades, Detective Mysteries, Viewing parties, Game Nights, Tapas dinners, Wine tastings and more. All of this for HALF the price of BPP's usual gala. $50 a person gets you a seat at some of the best tables in Bloomington and 100% of the profit goes back to BPP.

It’s simple: hosts have graciously donated a meal and their home for our month-long event and now it’s up to you to fill their table. We are currently in search of host. If you are interested in hosting, please contact Managing Director Brad Schiesser at [812-334-1188](tel:+1-812-334-1188) or [brad@newplays.org](mailto:brad@newplays.org)
