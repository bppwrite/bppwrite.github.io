In post-WWII New York City, the newspaper is king, and rambunctious reporter Flo is hungry for her big break. So when word hits the wires that a Soviet spy has landed in Manhattan, Flo follows the clues to get the scoop â€” and discovers more than she bargained for. With a golden-era Broadway score, dazzling dance numbers, loves lost (and found again), and non-stop fun, FRONT PAGE FLO is the world premiere musical that feels like seeing a classic for the very first time!
