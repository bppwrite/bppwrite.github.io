Agnes never paid much attention to her teenage sister, Tilly, who took refuge in the role-playing world. But when a tragedy strikes and Tilly is lost forever, Agnes goes searching in the one place she can still be found: her late sister's Dungeons & Dragons notebook. With the help of the game store clerk, Chuck, Agnes dives into the fantastical world of fairies, ogres, dragons, and even blood thirsty cheerleaders, in an action-packed comedy that searches for the warrior... and the geek... within us all.
