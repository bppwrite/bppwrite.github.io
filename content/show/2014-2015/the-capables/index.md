Anna Capable is a hoarder. The stacks of McDonald's happy meal toys, beanie babies, and useless junk pile straight up to the ceiling, forcing her daughter, Jessy, to call a TV network in hopes of clearing the mess and curing her mother. But the TV network's producer, David, is looking for more than just another cluttered home to get the ratings he needs. With his career on the line, he's hungry to expose the Capables' dirty laundry -- whether it's in their house, or their personal lives -- at all costs.
