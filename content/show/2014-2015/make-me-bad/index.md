**by special arrangement with The Benge Group**

What happens when you fall in love with a serial killer? This gritty and sexy musical thriller follows the story of Daisy Harris, a young woman stuck in a small town with a dead-end job, an overbearing mother, and a troubled past. Desperate to escape but with nowhere to go, Daisy looks for anything to break the monotony of her meaningless life. She meets charming and cryptic Max, just as a string of unexplained murders rocks the town. As the community continues to be plagued by gruesome killings, the relationship formed between the two not only reveals the atrocities of Daisy's past, but foreshadows the darkness that is to come.
