When Peg, a 70-something, Irish Catholic bird lover meets Irving, a 70-something Jewish, metal detector-toting East Coaster on an online dating site, it feels like love at first click. But after their crazy margarita-filled first date, complete with body shots and morning-after tattoos, Peg and Irving find that they still have a little aging to do if they want to forget their past and move forward into a future together.

Now in its 21st year, the [Reva Shiner Comedy Award](/playwrights/reva-shiner-comedy/) is a staple among comedy playwriting professionals world-wide.
