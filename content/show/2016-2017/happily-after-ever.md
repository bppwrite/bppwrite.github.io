Newlyweds Darren and Janet want nothing more than to build the perfect life together. But when Janet gives birth to a baby with both male and female genitalia, they find themselves in the unlikely position of having to choose a gender for their child - all while competing with the perfect couple next door and dealing with a misunderstood family dog - in this hilarious battle of the sexes.
