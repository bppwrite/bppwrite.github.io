All is peaceful at the Harmony Hill retirement community â€“ the rooms are comfy, the meals are tasty, and the citizen-run radio station is a hit (even if it only plays hits from the past). But when an executive waltzes in threatening to take over WLK 89.3 and turn it into a contemporary music station, the talented tenants of the senior center band together and hold a radiothon to keep it alive.

*Suitable for all ages.*

Box office opens at 6:30pm, house opens at 7pm, shows begin at 7:30pm.
