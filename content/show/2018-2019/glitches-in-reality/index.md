From the mind of renowned Australian magician, Simon Coronel, comes an evening filled with astonishing and impossible events. Glitches in Reality uses close-up trickery and mind-blowing sleight of hand to take the audience on a journey through the truth behind magic and illusion; a truth that is far more amazing than even the illusions themselves.

Winner of over a dozen international awards including multiple from the prestigious World Championships of Magic, Simon is a regular performer at the Magic Castle and is a university lecturer on perception and illusion.

*Suitable for all ages.*

The BPP box office opens at 6:30pm, house opens at 7pm, shows begin at 7:30pm.
