The rush of the city keeps rhythmic time, and five young people traveling down uncertain paths are caught up in the pulse of life in New York. This cutting-edge new musical from the acclaimed songwriting duo, [Carner and Gregor](http://www.carnerandgregor.com/), examines the struggle of finding love, the struggle of finding success, and, above all, the struggle of finding yourself in a big city where everyone seems somehow interconnected.  Produced in partnership with [Indiana University Theatre & Drama](http://www.indiana.edu/~thtr/), this innovative musical takes shape in a full production after its workshop on IU's campus.
