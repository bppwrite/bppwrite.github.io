Archie and Eudora have built a live studio audience in their living room. Being constantly observed helps them to lead an honest and honorable life. But things get awkward when some important visitors get a massive case of stage fright.  Then, when it's announced that an asteroid may be heading cataclysmically towards the Earth, all social order breaks down and the honest and honorable life takes a backseat to a frenzied, panicked mayhem. Also, in Act II, you will learn the meaning of life.

Now in its 21st year, the [Reva Shiner Comedy Award](/playwrights/reva-shiner-comedy/) is a staple among comedy playwriting professionals world-wide. BPP receives over 300 submissions from all around the world each year.  The winner receives a cash prize and a full production in the BPP Mainstage Season.  We don't just pick a funny one... we pick the funniest!
