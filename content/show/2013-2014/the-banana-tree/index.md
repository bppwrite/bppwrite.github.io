From the minds of The Simpsons stars, [Dan Castellaneta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Castellaneta) (Homer Simpson) and [Deb Lacusta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_Lacusta) (writer), comes a zany comedy about Angela, a convenience store clerk who dreams of being Las Vegas' first African American female magician. But after a series of hilarious run-ins and blunders, Angela finds herself in the middle of a robbery, a kidnapping, and at the mercy of a criminal mastermind that also happens to be a telepathic banana tree.
