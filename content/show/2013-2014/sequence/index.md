In this edge-of-your-seat science thriller, two intertwined stories teem with coincidence. In one, Time Magazine's Luckiest Man Alive has correctly bet on the Super Bowl coin toss 19 years in a row.  He is about to risk $880 million on the 20th until he's confronted by a young woman who may be able to prove that mathematics is behind his "luck."  In the other, an extremely unlucky man improbably guesses wrong on all 150 multiple choice questions of his science exam, which he feels is a sign from a higher power. Sequence is a mind-blowing, award-winning drama that asks, "What is luck?" Is it all random chance? Divine design? Or could it somehow be written in the sequence of our DNA?

Sequence was chosen as the best of the best from hundreds of submissions from around the world as part of the [Woodward/Newman Drama Award](/playwrights/woodward-newman-drama/) competition, named after two of the greatest actors of our time, Joanne Woodward & Paul Newman, and sponsored by Newman’s Own Foundation.  The theatre receives hundreds of submissions of plays from around the globe and presents the best new drama in the world with a prize of $3,000 and a full production as part of the BPP’s Mainstage Season.

Sequence is also part of the IU College of Arts and Sciences' semester-long initiative, "Themester 2013: Connectedness: Networks in a Complex World." Themester is a semester-long initiative  that combines academic courses, public lectures and exhibits, film showings and other events and is intended to engage students and the entire community in a collective learning experience about a timely, even urgent, issue.
