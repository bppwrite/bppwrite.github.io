Things aren't working out for Kate and Marlowe. He's an unemployed whiner, and despite her best efforts to stick with him, Kate just couldn't help cloning him. Twice. When one of the clones slips into Marlowe's life, and Kate discovers that she might not actually be the original Kate, things get scarier and funnier at the same time. Just what is marriage? And how far will we go to change each other—and ourselves—to stay together?

Now in its 20th year, the [Reva Shiner Comedy Award](/playwrights/reva-shiner-comedy/) is a staple among comedy playwriting professionals world-wide. The BPP receives hundreds of submissions from all around the globe each year. The winner receives a cash prize and a full production in the BPP season. We don't just pick a funny one... we pick the funniest!
