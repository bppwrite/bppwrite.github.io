**Based on the original film by Andrew Niccol**

Based on the beloved 1998 film, this musical follows Truman, an ordinary man unaware he's being watched by millions from all over the world. He lives in a large studio with hidden cameras everywhere. All his friends and townspeople are actors playing their roles in the most popular TV-series in the world: "The Truman Show". When an actress falls in love with him, she breaks onto the set to tell him the truth. But if your world were so perfect, would you want to listen?

The BPP and Indiana University Department of Theatre and Drama, the combination that brought last year's smash hit, Maggie Cassidy, will present The Truman Show: A Musical, based on the hit 1998 film starring Jim Carrey and directed by Peter Weir.
