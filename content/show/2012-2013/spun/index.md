Following their father's death, Molly and her estranged brother Jesse try to find a way to reconnect within the ruins of their childhood. But memories have a funny way of changing over time; and with two very different recollections blame, doubt, and rock 'n' roll become weapons. The composer and lyricist of the hit Kissing Frogs, Jeremy Schonfeld returns to create this high-octane musical that explores the complexities of family and story-telling, weaving together the memories and unique perspectives of siblings with comedy, wit, and rock.
