# About

The Bloomington Playwrights Project (BPP) is the only professional theatre in the entire state of Indiana dedicated solely to new plays. In operation for 35 years, we serve both the Bloomington and national theatre community by working with talented playwrights, actors, and artists to develop high-level productions for our local patrons as well as the many audiences attending subsequent productions of scripts that originated here at the BPP. We are an advocate for playwrights and new plays and believe firmly that they are not only important but absolutely vital to the future of our art form.

## Director's Circle

To bring a new play to life is an arduous and risky journey requiring a strong creative team and visionary supporters willing to provide the resources needed for the trip. The Directors Circle was established by the BPP Board in 2011 to bring together and to recognize loyal and generous patrons willing to provide annual support to the BPP’s operations now and into the future.

Each season the Directors Circle hosts five programs, each one related to one of the season’s productions. All provide behind-the-scenes insight into the new play production process. A program might consist of a scene from an upcoming production and a chance to discuss it with the principals behind the project. A scene designer might trace the creation of a set from concept to construction – describing the interaction with script, director, and other designers that goes into the process. Or a playwright may join us to describe the inspiration behind the play and the value of the development process that BPP provides.

Every program provides Directors Circle members not only a special theatre experience but also a chance to visit informally with the new play production team and with other supporters of new plays. To become part of the Directors Circle, contact <directorscircle@newplays.org>

## Mission & History

### Mission Statement

The Bloomington Playwrights Project (BPP) strives to be a leading artistic force in the production and encouragement of new plays. The BPP provides opportunities for development, education, and production for promising and established writers and theater artists in a professional environment.

### History

In 1979, the Bloomington Playwrights Project (BPP) was founded by Tom Moseman and Jim Leonard, both of whom shared a vision of creating a venue to workshop and produce playwrights' works, and provide a place for actors, directors, and theatre technicians to hone their crafts. Jim Leonard's play The Diviners has since seen many productions across the country, and he has gone on to write and produce for television, notably Skin and most recently Close to Home. Tom Moseman is currently Senior Vice President of Envirosell.

#### About the Timothy J Wiles Theater's Namesake

Timothy J Wiles had a passion for theater from his pre-adolescence. Growing up in Norway Maine (population 5,000) a village which boasted of enthusiastic community theater efforts (Tim worked stage crew for a popular production of Dial M For Murder when he was 13.) Tim avidly read the New York Times theater reviews.

In 1960 as a senior at Bethel Academy, he was selected to attend a national theater Institute for high school students at the Ohio State University. While there he attended a cycle of Shakespearean plays at Antioch College and his college plans were set in his mind. He majored in English at Antioch and became involved in multiple stage productions. He interned during one cooperative academic quarter at the McCarter Theater in Princeton. He studied for PhD at Stanford University and wrote a dissertation that became a University of Chicago publication: THE THEATER EVENT, a study of the process of catharsis in avant-garde European and American theater.

In 1972 he joined the English faculty at Indiana University, Bloomington and his undergraduate drama courses became known for their dramatic productions: he staged Brecht’s, THE MEASURES TAKEN in the woods behind Woodburn Hall, using Jordan creek as a part of the setting and he directed an innovative production of Apollinaire’s, THE BREASTS OF TIRESIAS, on the roof of the IMU.

In 1975 two theater students, Tom Moseman and Jim Poyser came to Tim and asked his to direct an independent study course in playwriting for them. Later they were joined by Jim Leonard, a graduate student who had a major success with his first play, THE DIVINERS, which had a won a national collegiate theater competition and been produced at the Kennedy Center.

The three asked Tim to mentor them and to help them found a black box theater to produce new and developing plays. For several years, the Bloomington Playwrights Project was a small, theater workshop for new playwrights like those three young playwriting students.

Tim Wiles served on the BPP Board of Directors for many years, served as President and Vice President of the Board through the 1990’s. He died in Bloomington in 2003.
