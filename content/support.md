# Support the BPP

As a 501\(c\)3 not-for-profit organization, the BPP relies on donations from individuals and businesses as well as grants and special event fundraisers. Only a small percentage of our overall budget comes from ticket sales so we rely on your generous and warmhearted support to continue to serve the Bloomington and national theatre communities.

Call us at {{< tel >}}, email us at <bppwrite@newplays.org>, or use PayPal:

## Productions

The BPP produces five Mainstage shows each season. Your support will help us to build the sets, pay our talented performers and crew, sew the costumes, hang the lights and all the things that go towards entertaining the Bloomington community.

## Education

The BPP operates a year-round education program serving ages 3-17. Your donation will go directly to improving the quality of our many youth theatre programs.

Visit the [Education](/education) section of this site to learn more about our programs.

## Facilities

Our theatre is constantly improving to meet the needs of our company as well as our numerous renters. Your support here will allow us to continue to improve our space.

## New Play Development

Many hours go into the development of anything that appears on our stage along with the local and national work we present through staged readings. A donation to new play development helps to cover the costs to bring these new works to life.
