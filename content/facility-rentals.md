The BPP's Ted Jones Playhouse boasts one of the most versatile rental spaces in Bloomington for anything from a theatre, dance performances, and film festivals to birthday parties, holiday events, and business meetings. BPP aims to keep our beautifully renovated,  handicap accessible building as multi-purpose and affordable as possible, to better serve the Bloomington community.

Our facility has a large, open-air lobby space housing a box office booth, concessions counter, art gallery, and the Lora Shiner Studio Stage. Our Timothy J. Wiles Mainstage Theatre seats 85, and features two dressing rooms, a tech booth, and a shop/paint space. The upstairs houses our office space, kitchen, as well as costume and props storage. The entire facility has a 180 person occupancy limit.

Please contact Chad Rabinovitz at <artisticdirector@newplays.org> for more details, rates, and availability.
