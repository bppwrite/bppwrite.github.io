# Facility Rentals

The BPP has one of the most sought-after rental spaces in Bloomington for anything from a theatre, dance performance, and film festivals to birthday parties, holiday events, and business meetings. Our newly renovated and handicap accessible building meets the needs of many and we aim to keep our prices as affordable as possible in order to better serve the Bloomington community.

Our facility has a large lobby space housing the Stone Belt art gallery and the Lora Shiner Studio Stage, our Timothy J. Wiles Mainstage Theatre seating 86, two Dressing Rooms, a Kitchen, Shop/Paint Space, Costume Storage, Props Storage, and Office Space.
