# Playwrights

## Submit a Play

The BPP makes calls for scripts several times each season for productions of new theatre. Please have a look at our ongoing opportunities to submit your new work:

* [Reva Shiner Comedy Award](reva-shiner-comedy)
* [Woodward/Newman Drama Award](woodward-newman-drama).

If you have questions regarding submissions to the Bloomington Playwrights Project, please contact the Literary Manager at <literarymanager@newplays.org>.

## Alumni Playwrights
