# MiniPlay Playwriting Contest

The highly successful and long-running MiniPlay Contest invites students in grades 3 â€“ 12 to submit original 7 - 10 minute plays in three categories (Elementary, Middle School & High School). Winning playwrights receive recognition in the local media and a staged reading of their winning play by local celebrities and adult actors at a special Education Event in their honor!

The BPP will select the three best plays in each category, based on how well the playwright crafts an original story, characters, and setting based upon the theme.
