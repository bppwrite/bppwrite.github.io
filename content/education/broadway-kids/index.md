Participants will explore the world of theatre through music, movement, visual arts, and performance. BPP focuses on fostering creativity and imagination through teaching the art of acting and storytelling. Students will learn improvisation techniques along with such introductory elements of acting. Our Broadway Kids will gain self-confidence, respect for others, and a greater ability to express themselves both physically and vocally. Students will be encouraged to speak in front of others, share things about themselves, and create and perform their original work on BPP's main stage
