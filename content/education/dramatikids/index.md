A virtual playground for young imaginations, DramatiKIDS is the perfect opportunity for young actors and writers to explore their creativity, learning skills in both acting and playwriting, culminating in an opportunity to star in a play they write themselves. This one-of-a-kind camp is the training ground for the promising young artists of tomorrow.


THEATRE INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITY!

The Bloomington Playwrights Project is looking for 2-3 theatre interns for our summer camps! We have various roles available based on your expertise. We are looking for interns who have experience in any or all of these areas: acting, directing, costuming, makeup, light / sound / set design, improvisation, or vocal coaching.

Please note 1, this is an unpaid internship but full summer interns will receive 2 subscriptions to the 2019-2020 BPP season. 2, you do NOT have to be available the entire summer. A full summer internship is May 27 - July 27, but partial summer internships are available for any of the BPP's four camps: Broadway Kids, DramatiKids, Laugh Factory, and Musical Theater Camp.

Please send your resume and brief cover letter, including which dates you are available, to Rachael Himsel: [education@newplays.org](mailto:education@newplays.org)

Deadline March 15th
