Students work with theatre professionals to develop and perform in their own original plays. A virtual playground for young imaginations, DramatiKIDS is the perfect opportunity for young actors and writers to explore their creativity, learning skills in both acting and playwriting, culminating in an opportunity to star in a play they write themselves.  This one-of-a-kind camp is the training ground for the promising young artists of tomorrow.
