Do you have a funny kid at the dinner table? Do they practice their jokes for you hours on end or stay up late to watch Saturday Night Live? Then send them over to BPP’s Laugh Factory where they’ll learn to perfect their comedic acting, joke writing, and quick thinking through sketch and improvisational comedy! Your kids will learn from teachers who have trained at Chicago’s Second City and Improv Olympic comedy theaters! Not only will they learn how to script and improvise an entire original comedy show, they will pick up confidence, collaboration, and communication skills through our improvisation and community-building curriculum. Note that this camp is also perfect for those kids who want to beef up their funny bone or just burst out of their shell in an open, accepting, and silly environment. This camp is just plain fun!
