Do you have a funny kid at the dinner table? Do they practice their jokes for you hours on end or stay up late to watch Saturday Night Live? Then send them over to BPP’s Laugh Factory where they’ll learn to perfect their comedic acting, joke writing, and improv abilities! Not only will they learn how to script and improvise an entire original comedy show, they will pick up confidence, collaboration, and communication skills through our improvisation and community-building curriculum. Note that this camp is also perfect for those kids who want to beef up their funny bone or just burst out of their shell in an open, accepting, and silly environment. This camp is just plain fun!



THEATRE INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITY!

The Bloomington Playwrights Project is looking for 2-3 theatre interns for our summer camps! We have various roles available based on your expertise. We are looking for interns who have experience in any or all of these areas: acting, directing, costuming, makeup, light / sound / set design, improvisation, or vocal coaching.

This internship is unpaid and partial summer internships are available. A full summer internship is May 27 - July 27, but partial summer internships are available for any of the BPP's four camps: Broadway Kids, DramatiKids, Laugh Factory, and Musical Theater Camp.

Please send your resume and brief cover letter, including which dates you are available, to Rachael Himsel: [education@newplays.org](mailto:education@newplays.org)
