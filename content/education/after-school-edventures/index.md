# After School EdVentures

The BPP offers drama clubs for elementary students through the After School EdVentures program.

## Where?

These clubs take place at Fairview, Templeton, Arlington Heights, Grandview, Summit, and Highland Park elementary schools.

## What? When?

Students in drama club learn and practice using the actors' tools of body, voice and imagination and develop skills to work creatively and collaboratively through improvisation and creative dramatics. K-2 students adapt a story, and older students collaborate on short skits for performance at the final class. The program enhances state school curricula by focusing on acting and storytelling.

## How?

The BPP's After School EdVentures is funded by a grant administered by the [Monroe County Community School Corporation (MCCSC) School Age Care](http://www.mccsc.edu/domain/64), as well as with support from the [Bloomington Arts Commission](http://bloomington.in.gov/BAC).
