In DramatiCATS (Comedy and Tragedy Stars), students are challenged with brainstorming characters and writing monologues, eventually culminating in their own two-character plays that the students will perform side-by-side with adult actors. DramatiCATS camper’s imaginations are challenged constantly while they create one of a kind new theatre.

Over the course of a two-week day camp, students work with theatre professionals to develop and perform in their own original plays. A virtual playground for young imaginations, DramatiCATS is directly in line with the BPP’s mission to be a leading artistic force in the production and encouragement of new plays and encourage promising young writers of tomorrow.
