Through BPP's Youth Education Program, over 13,000 kids have written new plays or performed on our stage. BPP operates the longest running and most trusted theatre education program in the area, with over 30 years of experience in arts education. We offer programming year-round for ages 5 and up, working in partnership with Ivy Tech Community College for summer camps and the MCCSC school system to teach theatre directly in the schools.

All of our classes and camps focus on the art of creating something new; whether itâ€™s a new character, a new story, or a new play. Students learn to collaborate with others and become comfortable with their body and voices while in many of the programs learning the tools needed to write and create their own play.
