Through the Ivy Tech-BPP Youth Education Program, sponsored by [IU Credit Union] (https://www.iucu.org/), over 13,000 kids have written new plays or performed on our stage. We operate the longest running and most trusted theatre education program in the area, with over 30 years of experience in arts education. We offer programming year-round for ages 5 and up, working in partnership with the [Ivy Tech Center for Lifelong Learning] (https://www.ivytech.edu/bloomington/cll/index.html) for summer camps, as well as with the MCCSC school system to engage students with theatre in their schools, during the school year.

All of our classes and camps focus on the art of creating something new; whether itâ€™s a new character, a new story, or a new play. Students learn to collaborate with others and become more confident and comfortable with their bodies and voices, while learning the skills needed to write and create their own new plays.
