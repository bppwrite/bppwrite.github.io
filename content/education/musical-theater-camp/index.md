Each year, students work with BPP professionals to write and produce an exciting new musical starring them! Over the course of this three week camp, students will learn the skills needed to produce and perform musical theatre, culminating in a series of full performances for the general public.
Â 
BPP's Musical Theatre Camp provides an intensive, summer stock experience. A rigorous rehearsal schedule and collaboration with theatre professionals give campers an exciting window into the demands and rewards of a life in theatre.
