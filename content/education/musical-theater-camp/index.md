BPP's MUSICAL THEATER CAMP is a summer camp geared toward youth in Grades 4-11 who have a passion for the stage. Each year students work with BPP professionals to write and produce an exciting new musical starring them! Over the course of this three week day camp, students will learn the skills needed to produce and perform musical theatre, culminating in a series of full performances for the general public.

Celebrating an amazing fifteen years of theatre outreach, BPP's Musical Theater Camp provides Bloomington's teens and 'tweens with an intensive, three-week, summer stock experience. A rigorous rehearsal schedule, collaboration with theatre professionals, and a special mid-camp cabaret night give campers an exciting window into the demands and rewards of a life in theatre.
