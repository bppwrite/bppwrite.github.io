Campers will work with BPP professionals to write and produce an exciting new musical starring them! Students will start by learning about - and singing songs from - popular Broadway musicals. They'll train as actors, singers, dancers, playwrights, and designers as they learn every element that goes into putting on a show. Over the course of this three week camp, students will gain the skills needed to create and perform a show, culminating in a series of performances of their original musical for the general public.

(Please note that backstage opportunities are available for kids who want to learn about costume/makeup design, lighting, and stage managing.)
