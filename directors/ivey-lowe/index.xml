      <description>Siblings Mordy and Jane communicate like proper millennials: primarily through text message and loaded with sarcasm. When their loving mother’s life becomes emotionally and financially taxed by their absolutely awful and 100-year-old grandfather, Zad-Zad, they draw together an elaborate plot to…relieve their mother’s burden. Told almost entirely via text messages, The Burdens is a dark, family comedy about how technology helps keep us close, while still enabling us to keep our distance.</description>

      <description>Brothers Steve and Marty Martin are on the brink of closing their failing pet funeral home, until an eccentric (and rich) new customer comes in with an amazing proposition: plan a funeral for her nearly dead racehorse, and she’ll give the boys a fortune to keep their business afloat. The only problem? The horse won’t die. With everything on the line, the two embark on a hysterical journey to see how far they’ll go to make their dreams come true, in this laugh-a-minute screwball comedy.</description>
