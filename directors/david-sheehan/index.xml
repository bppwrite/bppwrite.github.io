      <description>Sara, one of the world’s most brilliant planetary geologists, lives her life on Mars time — her days lasting longer and longer as she monitors mankind’s latest voyage to the Red Planet. But her daughter, Lis, continues to live her life as a teenager on Earth time, showing no interest in her mother’s world out in space—despite Sara’s best efforts. As both of their lives begin to spin out of control, they must grapple with the distance their two time zones create between them… even when they’re standing side by side.</description>

      <description>Katherine escaped from her small Texas home and her hypochondriac mother 9 years ago. When she finally steps back into her childhood home, Katherine is immediately overwhelmed by the familiar. Every room seems to have a story. Every corner of the house holds another recollection. Katherine’s memories become so vivid, in fact, they appear to come alive before her eyes. Both humorous and heartbreaking, HOME explores parenting and childhood with unflinching honesty, questioning what it means to grow older, and whether we truly have the capacity to grow up.</description>

      <description>Adele has abandoned her law school plans and her social life to take care of her addled father – a man who has trouble remembering who she is. A chance encounter with a musician named Vincent might just be the best thing to ever happen to her. The catch: Vincent has a rare neurological condition – he has face blindness. This season’s Woodward/Newman Drama Award winning play explores what it’s like to love without recognition and how two people might just keep each other from disappearing.</description>
