      <description>The rush of the city keeps rhythmic time, and five young people traveling down uncertain paths are caught up in the pulse of life in New York. This cutting-edge new musical from the acclaimed songwriting duo, Carner and Gregor, examines the struggle of finding love, the struggle of finding success, and, above all, the struggle of finding yourself in a big city where everyone seems somehow interconnected. Produced in partnership with Indiana University Theatre &amp;amp; Drama, this innovative musical takes shape in a full production after its workshop on IU&amp;rsquo;s campus.</description>
