      <description>Donate to the 2017 Ike &amp;amp; Julie Arnove PlayOffs!
It’s that time of the year again for the Ike &amp;amp; Julie Arnove PlayOffs. The time of year when we separate the contenders from the pretenders, the pros from the joes, the heroes from the zeros. Yes, that’s right, the baseball playoffs are just around the corner. In celebration, the BPP is presenting its most electrifying, action-packed, and anticipated fundraising event of the year, the Ike &amp;amp; Julie Arnove PlayOffs.</description>
