      <description>Ever hear the one about the unsuccessful comedian and his garbage sculpting wife? They strive for the American dream while struggling to pay their bills, escape eviction and cope with friends who increasingly seem like strangers. Life, they tell their kids, is sort of like Dad&amp;rsquo;s monologues: no matter how fearlessly you struggle you&amp;rsquo;re only as good as your punch line.
Lemonade was chosen as the best out of 450 submissions from around the world as part of its Woodward/Newman Drama Competition, named after two of the greatest actors of our time, Joanne Woodward &amp;amp; Paul Newman and sponsored by Newman&amp;rsquo;s Own Foundation.</description>
