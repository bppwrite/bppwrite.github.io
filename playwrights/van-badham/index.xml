      <description>Marion tries not to fall for Michael, her handsome (and very married) co-worker. But as Marion and Michael become entangled in each other, the museum where they work comes under a mysterious, mythological attack. A beast is roaming through the halls; a beast that threatens to destroy Marionâ€™s capacity for love and to leave her wondering if she ever wants to find it again. The U.S. premiere of an award-winning new Australian play, THE BULL, THE MOON AND THE CORONET OF STARS is a magical, passionate, and charming love story of mythic proportions.</description>
