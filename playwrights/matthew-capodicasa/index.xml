      <description>Adele has abandoned her law school plans and her social life to take care of her addled father – a man who has trouble remembering who she is. A chance encounter with a musician named Vincent might just be the best thing to ever happen to her. The catch: Vincent has a rare neurological condition – he has face blindness. This season’s Woodward/Newman Drama Award winning play explores what it’s like to love without recognition and how two people might just keep each other from disappearing.</description>
